    <h2>INDUSTRIAL VISITS</h2>
    <H3>TVS MOTORS, HOSUR</H3>
    <P>As an aspiring engineer, visiting industries is always an exciting and educational experience. On August 19, 2022, I had the opportunity to visit the TVS Motors industry, and it was an enriching experience for me. TVS Motors is a renowned two-wheeler manufacturer that is popular for its high-quality products and innovative technology.

        The visit started with a brief presentation about the history and background of the company. The speaker also explained the various products manufactured by TVS Motors and their unique features. It was fascinating to learn about the intricate details of the two-wheelers and the extensive research and development that goes into creating a perfect product.
        
        Next, we were taken on a guided tour of the factory floor, where we saw the various stages of manufacturing.

    <p>We observed the assembly line and the different components that were used to create a bike. The process was highly automated and precise, ensuring that the products were of high quality. It was impressive to see the level of automation, which led to the reduction of labor and increased efficiency in production.
        
        We also had the opportunity to interact with some of the engineers working at TVS Motors. They gave us an insight into their daily work, and the kind of challenges they face while designing and manufacturing the products. It was inspiring to see the dedication and passion they had for their work.</p>
    <h3>TITAN company</h3>
    <p>On the 11th of February 2023, I had the opportunity to visit the Titan Watch Company, one of the leading manufacturers of watches in the world. It was an insightful and informative experience that gave me an in-depth understanding of the watch industry and the processes involved in the production of watches.

        As I walked into the Titan Watch Company's factory, I was struck by the sheer scale of the operations. </p>
        <image src="images/WhatsApp Image 2023-02-11 at 6.15.48 PM.jpeg" class="titan"></image>
        <p>The factory was a sprawling complex, with various departments and units dedicated to different aspects of the production process. I was greeted by the factory manager, who took me on a guided tour of the factory.
        
            The first department we visited was the design and development department, where the watch designs were conceived and developed. Here, I saw the team of designers and engineers working on various designs, creating sketches and digital renderings of the watches. It was interesting to see the different stages of the design process, from the initial concept to the final prototype.
            
            Next, we visited the production department, where the watches were assembled. The production process was a complex one, involving several stages, including stamping, machining, and assembly. I was particularly impressed by the precision and attention to detail that went into the production of each watch. The production lines were automated, with robots handling many of the repetitive tasks, while the skilled workers took care of the more delicate and intricate parts of the process.</p>
