<h2>IEEE ACTIVITIES</h2>
<H3>SIGHT DAY VISIT</H3>
<p>As a senior in engineering, I had the pleasure of conducting a webinar at RBANC School to share my knowledge and insights with a group of curious and ambitious students who were interested in pursuing a career in this field. During the webinar, I discussed various aspects of engineering, ranging from its history and evolution to the latest trends and developments in the industry.

    I began the webinar by giving an overview of what engineering is and how it has evolved over time. </p>
    
<image src="images/1651468168435.jfif"  class="School"></image>
<P class="txt3">I discussed the various fields of engineering, including civil, mechanical, electrical, and chemical, and the various sub-disciplines within each field. I also highlighted the importance of engineering in modern society and how it has contributed to the development of many aspects of our daily lives.
    
    Next, I discussed the skills required to be a successful engineer, including problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration.</P>

    <!-----------------------------------in article ads--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <p class="txt4">I also stressed the importance of a strong educational background, as well as hands-on experience in the field. I shared some tips on how to prepare for a career in engineering, including taking challenging courses in math and science, participating in internships, and joining engineering clubs and organizations.</p>

<h3>ON SITE VISIT , KANYAKUMARI</h3>
<p>Kanyakumari, located at the southernmost tip of India, is famous for its beautiful beaches and scenic views. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Kanyakumari to witness the implementation of an advanced boat monitoring system that utilizes artificial intelligence. It was an enlightening experience to see how technology is being used to enhance the safety of the fishermen and improve their livelihood.

    As I reached Kanyakumari beach, I was greeted by the beautiful blue waters and the sound of waves crashing on the shore. The boat monitoring system was set up by a team of scientists and engineers from a local research institute. The system was designed to monitor the movement of fishing boats in real-time using AI algorithms.
    
    </p>
<image src="images/beach.jpg" class="kk"></image>
<p class="txt2">The system comprises a network of cameras and sensors that are installed on boats to monitor their movement, speed, and location. The data is then transmitted to a central computer system that uses AI algorithms to analyze the data and provide insights. The system can detect the presence of boats in restricted areas and send an alert to the authorities. This helps to prevent accidents and reduce the risk of fishermen getting lost at sea.</p>

    <h2>ORGANISING ACTIVITIES</h2>
    <H3>E-AXION 2K22</H3>
    <p>It gives me an immense pleasure in being a part of E-Axion 2k22, a National level Technical Symposium, conducted at St. Jospeh's Institute of Technology, by the department of ECE.

        I learnt a lot from this symposium, and had a great opppurtunity to interact with my seniors as well as my juniors and work along with them.  
        </p>
    <image src="images/banner.jpg" class="sympoposter"></image>
    <p class="TXT">I was a coordinator for the event Desert Drive (a robo race competition) and made all the plans for the event and made the event a great success.
    
        The plans for the event we did are the track design, decoration for the event, promoting the event, attracting participants,miniature model for the event. 
        
        Efforts and hardworks that we put in to this event gave us a lot of learnings and good memories and a lot of good intakes of coordination, team works and all.</p>

<h3>SYMPOSIUM POSTER CREATION</h3>
<p>As part of the Eaxion National Level Symposium conducted by St. Joseph's Institute of Technology, I had the opportunity to create a poster for the event. The theme of the symposium was "Innovative Technologies for a Sustainable Future," which inspired me to think about the impact of technology on the environment and how we can use it to create a more sustainable future.</p>
<image src="images/InShot_20230216_204436402.jpg" class="poster"></image>

<p>All these poster are made in canva,i can also make photoshop designs. I was always very interested in photo editing and illustration designs and i think this helped me to do all these stuffs within a limited period!</p>

    <h2>DEPARTMENT INVOLMENTS</h2>
    <H3>ORGANISING-ROBOTICS CLUB</H3>
    <p>As an active member of our own departments club,the robotics club, I organised and conducted many webinars and events.During my 2nd year of my degree i heard about the club which was not active at that time.At that instance I got some ideas to redevelop the club,So I and my classmates decided to conduct many webinars and events to bring some audience to the club.Before that we created awareness and promoted the club to each and every department in our institute.</p>
<image src="images/roboweb.PNG" class="webinar"></image>
<p>Still I considering this was my biggest achivement of my career also feeling so proud about this and being part of this wonderful club.</p>
<h3>ROBO RACE</h3>
<P>Robo race events have become increasingly popular in recent years, with robotics enthusiasts from all over the world coming together to showcase their engineering and programming skills. Organizing a successful robo race event requires careful planning and execution, as well as a deep understanding of the needs and expectations of both the participants and the audience.So I and my classmates decided to conduct the robo race in our club.we did some research about this event,did some 3d models and simulation about the output,did some sketch and finally we've done the track.</P>
<image src="images/robotrack.jpg" class="track"></image>
<p>This event attracted the audience very much.many of the juniors came forwarded ,done robots and participated in that event.The department was so much satisfied with this and recognised us!! </p>
